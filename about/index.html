        <p>It’s hard being a solo founder.</p>

        <p>Most startups fail. Even more solo founder startups fail.</p>

        <p>It's no wonder why...</p>

        <ul>
          <li><b>Mental Health</b> - you're going alone, against the grain</li>
          <li>
            <b>Resources</b> - you have ½ or ⅓ the resources of most founding
            teams
          </li>
          <li><b>Skills</b> - limited skillset in founding team</li>
          <li><b>Ideation</b> - no co-founder to bounce ideas off of</li>
          <li>
            <b>Feedback</b> - no one going through the same process who can give
            you detailed feedback
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Decision making</b> - no one to stop you making bad decisions
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>It's less fun</b> - there's no one who truly understands and is
            there to cheer you up when things go wrong
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Accountability</b> - no co-founder relying on you / to keep you
            in check
          </li>
          <li><b>Expensive</b> - slower, paying for limitations</li>
          <li><b>Investment</b> - investors less likely to invest</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
          <li><b>Community</b></li>
          <p>
            Be nice. Relationships matter and collaboration is key. Give and get
            back to and from your fellow tribe members.
          </p>
          <li><b>Execution</b></li>
          <p>
            Ideas are worthless. What's important? Getting stuff done and
            figuring stuff out.
          </p>
          <li><b>Iteration</b></li>
          <p>
            Keep evolving your idea in response to customer feedback, not sure
            what to do? Speak to your customers.
          </p>
          <li><b>Vulnerability</b></li>
          <p>
            Awareness of your weaknesses is just as important as awareness of
            your strengths.
          </p>
          <li><b>Diversity</b></li>
          <p>
            Different backgrounds, different ways of thinking, different
            networks; a strong tribe is a diverse tribe.
